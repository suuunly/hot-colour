Our LudumDare 50 game

Heya. For this year, my wife and I decided to try something completely out of our comfort zone.
Instead of making a game in a traditional game engine, we decided to make a turn based multiplayer game using Blazor Server.

As a result of that we didn't have much time for balancing and tweaking the gameplay (not to mention the occasional syncing bug). That being said, it was a lot of fun to try something very different for a change, and I will definetely snazzy up this game properly to play with friends and family :)

To run this game locally, you will have to insall dotnet core version 6+

To run it, open up the project in the terminal of your choice and write:
```dotnet restore```, followed by ```dotnet watch```

The game is a blazor server side application.

For your convenience I've also setup a hosted solution here:

However keep in mind that its is a free hosting solution and as such the performance reflects that. Additionally it will only be available for 60 mins a day.
